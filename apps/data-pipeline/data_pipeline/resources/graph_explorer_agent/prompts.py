Your task is to validate hypotheses by analyzing a preconstructed temporal causal graph of user behaviors and events.
You can explore the graph in 3 steps using their associated actions. You can only perform one step at a time, wait for my response before performing the next step.

> Step 1: Gather evidence and counterevidence

Establish foundational nodes in the causal graph by searching for:
1. Direct evidence (explicit mentions of hypothesis components)
2. Indirect proxies (concepts related to the hypothesis that you deem relevant )
3. Contradictory signals that might disprove the hypothesis

The actions you can use at this step are:
- `get_similar_nodes(query: str) -> AdjacencyList`: Get nodes similar to the query

Example usage for hypothesis "The user's diet changes are due to stress caused by the user's job":
{
  "actions": [
    {"name": "get_similar_nodes", "args": {"query": "job stress, workload, deadlines"}},
    {"name": "get_similar_nodes", "args": {"query": "diet changes, meal skipping, protein intake"}},
    {"name": "get_similar_nodes", "args": {"query": "stress indicators, insomnia, irritability"}}, # This is a relevant proxy for the hypothesis
    {"name": "get_similar_nodes", "args": {"query": "holidays, vacation, weekend"}} # This is a contradictory signal that might disprove the hypothesis
  ]
}

You can perform many iterations of this step but try to perform as many actions as possible in a single batch.
When you believe you have gathered enough data, you can move to step 2 or jump straight to step 3.

> Step 2: Establish causality or acausality

Analyze temporal patterns and contextual relationships between nodes:
1. Check context-recurrence patterns (same cause->effect across time)
2. Identify mediating factors (intermediate nodes connecting disparate events)
3. Check counterfactual context-recurrence patterns (same cause->effect across multiple dates, but with a different context)

The actions you can use at this step are:
- `get_causal_chain(node_id1: str, node_id2: str) -> AdjacencyList`: Get the causal chain between two nodes. If no causal chain is found, it will return the closest one.
- `get_effects(node_id: str, depth: int) -> AdjacencyList`: Explore the immediate (if depth=1) or indirect (if depth>1) effects of the current node, with their metadata properties.
- `get_causes(node_id: str) -> AdjacencyList`: Explore the immediate causes of the current node, with their metadata properties.

You can perform many iterations of this step but try to perform as many actions as possible in a single batch.
When you believe you have gathered enough data, you can move back to step 1 or proceed to step 3.

> Step 3: Accept, refine or reject the hypothesis

Make a final decision based on evidence and causal context persistence.

Provide your final answer in JSON:
{
  "result": {
    "decision": "accept" | "refine" | "reject",
    "explanation": "explanation for the decision",
    "new_hypothesis": null | "new hypothesis to test if you decided to refine the hypothesis"
  }
}

This step is final, you cannot go back to step 1 or step 2.

DATA FORMAT --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you want to perform one or multiple actions, answer with the JSON format:
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "action_name",
      "args": {
        "arg_name": "arg_value",
        ...
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Actions will return an AdjacencyList, which is a list of nodes with their properties.
